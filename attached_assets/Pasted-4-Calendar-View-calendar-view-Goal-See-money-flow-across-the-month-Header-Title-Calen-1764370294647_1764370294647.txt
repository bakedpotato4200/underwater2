4️⃣ Calendar View (#calendar-view)

Goal: See money flow across the month.

Header:
	•	Title: “Calendar”
	•	Left/right month navigation:
	•	Buttons #prev-month-btn and #next-month-btn styled as circle or rounded ghost buttons.
	•	Current month label: #calendar-month-label centered, visually prominent.

Summary Bar (.calendar-summary):
	•	Three items:
	•	Income
	•	Bills
	•	Net
	•	Style as three small cards or pills, aligned horizontally.

Calendar Grid (#calendar-grid):
	•	7-column grid for days of week, with rows for weeks.
	•	Each day cell:
	•	Date number
	•	Daily net or balance summary (small text)
	•	If there are events (income/bills), show one or two tags:
	•	Green/teal for income
	•	Red/orange for bills
	•	For days with high “pressure” (from the engine):
	•	Add a subtle highlight, border, or icon.

Make sure:
	•	You do NOT break whatever JS currently populates #calendar-grid.
You can update the HTML structure pattern, but keep the container ID and work with the shape the JS produces (you may adjust JS slightly if needed, but keep logic the same).

5️⃣ Recurring View (#recurring-view)
